# Community Techaid Windows

This repo is for the various tools, files and instructions for sorting out a fresh install of Windows 10 on a donated laptop.

The current process:
- wipe machine
- install Windows
- install programmes & drivers
- install windows updates

The aim:
- have virtualised machine running in the CTA office to provide updates via the P2P update distribution built into Windows 10.
- consolidate installing Windows and programmes into one step with a customised ISO, using the virtual machine as the reference

Nice to haves:
- PXE setup to deploy windows avoid having to burn ISOs to USB sticks etc
